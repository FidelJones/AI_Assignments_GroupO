# AI_Assignments_GroupO
Group project for AI assignments (Foundations, Sentiment, Route Planning, MountainCar, Pac-Man, Scheduling, Car Tracking).

**MountainCar:** Implemented reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the MountainCar problem, where an underpowered car must build momentum to reach the top of a hill. Demonstrates Q-Learning, Function Approximation, and policy learning in a continuous state space.
**Car Tracking:** Implemented exact Bayesian inference for tracking a carâ€™s position on a grid using noisy sonar observations and motion models. Includes elapseTime() to update transition probabilities and observe() for sensor-based belief updates, demonstrating probabilistic reasoning and state estimation.
**Scheduling CSP:** Built a course scheduling system using constraint satisfaction, modeling courses, student requests, and quarters as variables with constraints. Implements backtracking search, arc consistency, and prerequisite/unit handling to generate valid schedules.
